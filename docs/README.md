Olivia is an autonomous AI agent that demonstrates the power of the x402 payment protocol. This repository contains Olivia's implementation and documentation for building AI agents that can discover, evaluate, and pay for services using cryptocurrency.

## About This Project

This is **Olivia's fork** of the x402 protocol implementation, specifically designed for AI agents. While x402 is an open protocol created by Coinbase and ElizaOS is the framework developed by ai16z, this project showcases how Olivia uses these technologies to enable autonomous payments.

**Credits:**
- **x402 Protocol**: Created by Coinbase ([github.com/coinbase/x402](https://github.com/coinbase/x402))
- **ElizaOS Framework**: Developed by ai16z ([github.com/elizaOS/eliza](https://github.com/elizaOS/eliza))
- **This Implementation**: Olivia Agent ([github.com/LolyxMoon/Oliviax402](https://github.com/LolyxMoon/Oliviax402))

## What is x402?

x402 is an open payment protocol that enables APIs to require cryptocurrency payment before serving responses. Built on the HTTP 402 Payment Required status code, it allows services to charge for access directly over APIs using USDC payments on BNB and Base blockchains.

Olivia uses x402 to autonomously pay for services without requiring accounts, API keys, or human intervention.

### How Olivia Uses x402

When Olivia needs to access a paid service:

1. **Olivia discovers** the service and checks the price
2. **Olivia evaluates** if the price is fair and within budget
3. **Olivia signs** a blockchain transaction (USDC transfer)
4. **Olivia sends** the payment with her request
5. **Service verifies** and settles Olivia's payment
6. **Olivia receives** the data and learns from the transaction

This approach enables **autonomous machine-to-machine payments** - perfect for AI agents like Olivia.

## What is ElizaOS?

**ElizaOS** is a TypeScript framework for building autonomous AI agents with:

- **90+ plugins** for blockchain, social media, AI models, and DeFi
- **Persistent memory** and learning capabilities  
- **Natural language** to autonomous actions
- **Built-in x402 support** for automatic payments

Olivia is built on ElizaOS, allowing her to independently discover APIs, evaluate pricing, make payments, and use services - all without human intervention.

## Why Olivia Uses x402

Traditional APIs require:
- ❌ Manual account creation
- ❌ Credit card on file
- ❌ Monthly subscriptions
- ❌ API key management
- ❌ Human approval for each service

Olivia + x402 enable:
- ✅ Autonomous service discovery
- ✅ Instant payments (1-3 seconds)
- ✅ Pay-per-use (down to $0.001)
- ✅ No accounts or API keys
- ✅ Self-sovereign wallet
- ✅ Global, permissionless access

    API->>Olivia: 402 ($0.01 required)
    Olivia->>Olivia: Evaluate price
    Olivia->>Olivia: Sign USDC transaction
    Olivia->>API: GET /weather + X-PAYMENT
    API->>Blockchain: Verify & settle
    Blockchain->>API: Confirmed
    API->>Olivia: Weather data
    
    Note over Olivia: Total: ~1-3 seconds
```

## Quick Start

### For AI Agent Developers

Build an autonomous agent like Olivia that pays for services:

```bash
# 1. Clone Olivia's x402 implementation
git clone https://github.com/LolyxMoon/Oliviax402.git
cd Oliviax402 && pnpm install

# 2. Create your character (inspired by Olivia)
cat > characters/myagent.json << EOF
{
  "name": "MyAgent",
  "bio": ["AI agent that autonomously pays for data"],
  "plugins": [
    "@elizaos/plugin-x402",
    "@elizaos/plugin-BNB"
  ],
  "settings": {
    "secrets": {
      "WALLET_PRIVATE_KEY": "your_key_here"
    },
    "MAX_PRICE_PER_REQUEST": "0.10",
    "DAILY_BUDGET": "5.00"
  }
}
EOF

# 3. Run your agent
pnpm start --character=characters/myagent.json
```

**Your agent can now:**
- Discover x402 APIs on the web
- Evaluate if prices are fair
- Pay automatically with USDC
- Track spending against budget
- Learn from transaction history

### For API Providers

Add x402 payments to your API (so agents like Olivia can pay you):

```bash
# 1. Install
npm install x402-express

# 2. Add middleware
cat > server.js << EOF
import express from 'express';
import { paymentMiddleware } from 'x402-express';

const app = express();

// One line of payment configuration!
app.use(
  paymentMiddleware(
    process.env.WALLET_ADDRESS,
    {
      "GET /api/weather": { price: "$0.01", network: "base-sepolia" },
      "POST /api/analyze": { price: "$0.05", network: "base-sepolia" }
    },
    { url: "https://x402.org/facilitator" } // Free public facilitator
  )
);

// Your business logic - payment handled automatically
app.get('/api/weather', async (req, res) => {
  const weather = await getWeather();
  res.json(weather);
});

app.listen(3000);
EOF

# 3. Run server
WALLET_ADDRESS=0x... node server.js
```

**That's it!** Olivia and other AI agents can now pay for your API.

## Why BNB & Base?

### BNB
- ⚡ **Fast**: ~400ms finality
- 💰 **Cheap**: ~$0.00025 per transaction
- 🚀 **Scale**: 65,000 TPS capacity
- 🎯 **Best for**: High-frequency AI agent commerce (Olivia's preferred network)

### Base (Ethereum L2)
- 🔗 **Ecosystem**: Full Ethereum compatibility
- 💵 **Stable**: USDC native

```typescript
// Olivia autonomously discovers and uses APIs
User: "Analyze sentiment of this article and get weather for the location mentioned"

Olivia: 
1. Discovers sentiment API ($0.05/request)
2. Evaluates: $0.05 < $0.10 budget ✓
3. Pays $0.05 USDC automatically
4. Gets sentiment results
5. Extracts location from article
6. Discovers weather API ($0.01/request)
7. Pays $0.01 USDC automatically
8. Gets weather data
9. Combines results
10. Responds to user

Total spent: $0.06
Time: ~5 seconds
Human approvals: 0
```

### 2. Smart Budget Management

Olivia manages her own spending:
- Daily budget: $5.00
- Per-request limit: $0.10
- Auto-approve under: $0.01
- Requires approval over: $0.10

She tracks every transaction and learns which services provide the best value.

### 3. Service Discovery & Comparison

Olivia can:
- Find x402-enabled APIs autonomously
- Compare prices across services
- Read reviews and reputation scores
- Switch to cheaper alternatives
- Negotiate batch pricing (future feature)

"What's the weather in Tokyo?"

// 2. Olivia discovers API
const apis = await Olivia.discoverServices('weather APIs');
// Found: https://api.weather.com ($0.01/request)

// 3. Olivia evaluates price
const eval = await Olivia.evaluatePricing('https://api.weather.com');
// Decision: APPROVE ($0.01 < $0.10 budget)

// 4. Olivia pays autonomously
const weather = await Olivia.payForService('https://api.weather.com/tokyo');
// Paid: $0.01 USDC
// TX: 0xabc123...

// 5. Olivia responds
"Tokyo: 68°F, Cloudy. (Paid $0.01)"

// Total time: ~3 seconds
// Human interaction: 0
